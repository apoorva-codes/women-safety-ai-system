# Women’s Safety Analytics: AI-Driven Threat Detection & Mobile Security

## Overview

Women’s safety remains a critical global concern, with many existing solutions relying heavily on manual user intervention during emergencies. This project presents a completed intelligent safety system that integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile technologies to provide proactive protection and rapid emergency response.

The system analyzes contextual data such as location, time, environmental conditions, and behavioral patterns to detect potential threats in real time. Automated alerts are triggered through gesture recognition, voice commands, wearable sensor data, and anomaly detection, ensuring user safety even when manual interaction is not possible.
